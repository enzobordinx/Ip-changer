# Ip-changer
This tkinter code creates a GUI that displays a computer's IP details when 'Show IP' button is pressed. Users can switch between DHCP and static IP settings and input new IP, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS values. Successful changes show a message box while errors prompt an error message.
